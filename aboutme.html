                <h4>Who am I?</h4>
                <p>I'm 23 years old, and I proudly call Zenica my hometown. Technology has been my thing since forever,
                    and my passion for it keeps growing. This portfolio website is a window into my world, where I share
                    not only my professional journey but also a glimpse into my hobbies and interests. It's a space
                    where I showcase my skills and experiences, both from the tech world and my personal endeavors.
                    While this site offers a sneak peek, there's so much more to explore and discuss, and I'm looking
                    forward to sharing those stories, experiences, and insights during our chats and interviews. Let's
                    keep some surprises in store!</p>

                <h4>My artistic soul</h4>
                <p>Besides technology, another constant in my life has been art. I attended both a music school and
                    ballet classes. I play the <i>violin</i>, <i>piano</i>, and <i>guitar</i>, and I used to dance
                    <i>ballet</i>. These creative
                    pursuits have added a rich layer to my life, where I find inspiration and balance.

                <p>Despite my numerous travels and participation in various competitions, one particular memory stands
                    out — <i>Moscow International Festival of Slavic Music</i>. It's a moment I hold dear and always
                    cherish,
                    because I was awarded a special prize.</p>

            <article class="article">
                <p>Even though everyone believed I would build my career in the arts, things took a slightly different
                    turn. <br>Despite the seemingly opposite worlds of the artistic realm in which I once lived and
                    today's
                    coding universe, I've always convinced people that coding is a form of art for me. It's the
                    harmonious blend of systematic chaos, much like art.</p>

                <h4>My free time</h4>
                <p>When I had to leave ballet, which had been my primary artistic focus, I redirected my
                    attention, especially during high school, to <i>youth organizations</i>. <br>I realized just how
                    many
                    life
                    lessons we never learn in traditional classrooms, so I shifted my focus towards developing my soft
                    skills, which were lacking, and engaging in <i>activism</i>.</p>

                    soft skills and technical expertise, bridging the gap between classroom knowledge and real-world
                    experiences. It's not just about expanding my own knowledge; I'm also passionate about connecting
                    with industry professionals who generously share their insights, provide guidance, and open doors to
                    continuous learning. Their mentorship helps me learn from their successes and setbacks, and it's a
                    journey of shared experiences and common interests. Together, we're not just dreaming but turning

                <img src="images/telecom.png">
                <p>During my final year of college, I had the opportunity to undertake a mandatory internship. <br>I
                    spent
                    one month at BH Telecom in directorate Zenica, working in the <i>Department for Technical
                        Support</i>, specifically
                    within the

                <p>During this internship, I also worked in the team of <i>Communications Solutions and
                        Preparation Office, participating in optical cable testing, and even engaging in fieldwork</i>.
                    <br>Besides
                    gaining various technical skills, this experience provided insights into how a <i>large corporation
                        operates</i>.
                    <br>It highlighted the significance of <i>documentation and archives</i>, which were topics we
                    theoretically
                    covered during my college studies.

                <p>I'm particularly thrilled about the skills I gained through various group and individual projects.
                    These experiences introduced us to <i>agile methodologies</i> and <i>version control</i>, enhancing
                    our ability to
                    manage software development effectively. Alongside the multitude of programming languages, we
                    explored a diverse set of tools and platforms for the entire software development lifecycle. From
                    designing in <i>Figma</i> and <i>3D modeling tools</i> to web development using <i>Java Spring Boot,
                        Node.js, and
                        React</i>, we ventured into <i>MySQL</i> for database management, <i>.NET MAUI</i> for mobile
                    app development, and
                    utilized tools like <i>Visual Paradigm</i> for software development and documentation. We also
                    dabbled in
                    <i>systems and network administration</i>, and <i>manual and automated testing in Selenium</i> among
                    other subjects. Despite the extensive curriculum, it
                    provided us with a solid foundation for our future endeavors.

                        Polytechnic Faculty</a>, I acquired an array of technical skills,

                    me the most were <i>embedded

                <p>Specifically, my graduate thesis revolved around the concept of a <i>smart home</i>. Using
                    <i>Arduino</i> and the
                    <i>Blynk IoT</i> application, I designed a prototype of a smart home with features such as mood
                    light
                    control, heating, ventilation, plant irrigation, and an alarm system. This project allowed me to

                    development techniques for various types of applications. While I'm increasingly drawn to AI, I
