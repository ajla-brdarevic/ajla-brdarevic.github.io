                    <p>Currently, I am open to exploring a wide range of career opportunities within the field of
                        software engineering. I embrace the idea of versatility and am not hesitant to venture into
                        any
                        career path that aligns with my passion and expertise. I firmly believe that every
                        opportunity,
                        regardless of its specific focus, has the potential to be a stepping stone in my journey. My
                        plan
                        for the future is to pursue a master's degree in software engineering, allowing me to
                        complete the
                        bigger picture.<br><br>
                        Along the way, I aim to gain valuable work experience to further develop my technical
                        skills,
                        and to explore different facets of the industry to find the path I'd like to commit to in
                        the long
                        run. While my studies have exposed me to a broad spectrum of topics, a few areas have
                        particularly
                        piqued my interest: Embedded systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) and I've delved into
                        diverse
                        back-end development techniques for various types of applications. While I'm increasingly
                        drawn to AI, I
                        acknowledge that I may not yet possess the depth of knowledge and experience required to
                        prioritize it as my sole focus.<br> <br>
                        Moreover, I've always been drawn to the idea of blending my technical expertise with skills
                        I've acquired over time and excel in naturally. Collaborating within a team dynamic and
                        assuming leadership roles is one such skill set. Hence, I've chosen this career path,
                        allowing me to integrate my evolving technical skills with my passion for exploring business
                        strategies
                        and life cycle of developing a certain product.
