                <h4>Who am I?</h4>
                <p>I'm 23 years old, and I proudly call Zenica my hometown. Technology has been my thing since forever,
                    and my passion for it keeps growing. This portfolio website is a window into my world, where I share
                    not only my professional journey but also a glimpse into my hobbies and interests. It's a space
                    where I showcase my skills and experiences, both from the tech world and my personal endeavors.
                    While this site offers a sneak peek, there's so much more to explore and discuss, and I'm looking
                    forward to sharing those stories, experiences, and insights during our chats and interviews. Let's
                    keep some surprises in store!</p>

                <h4>My artistic soul</h4>
                <p>Besides technology, another constant in my life has been art. I attended both a music school and
                    ballet classes. I play the <i>violin</i>, <i>piano</i>, and <b>guitar</b>, and I used to dance
                    <b>ballet</b>. These creative
                    pursuits have added a rich layer to my life, where I find inspiration and balance.

                <img src="images/ballet.jpg">
                <p>Despite my numerous travels and participation in various competitions, one particular memory stands
                    out — <b>the Slavic Countries Festival in Moscow in 2014</b>. It's a moment I hold dear and always
                    cherish,
                    because I was awarded a special prize.</p>
            </article>
            <article class="article">
                <p>Even though everyone believed I would build my career in the arts, things took a slightly different
                    turn. <br>Despite the seemingly opposite worlds of the artistic realm in which I once lived and
                    today's
                    coding universe, I've always convinced people that coding is a form of art for me. It's the
                    harmonious blend of systematic chaos, much like art.</p>

                <h4>My free time</h4>
                <p>When I had to leave ballet, which had been my primary artistic focus, I redirected my
                    attention, especially during high school, to <b>youth organizations</b>. <br>I realized just how
                    many
                    life
                    lessons we never learn in traditional classrooms, so I shifted my focus towards developing my soft
                    skills, which were lacking, and engaging in <b>activism</b>.</p>

                <img src="images/eyp.jpg">
                <p>Among the numerous organizations, one captured my attention the most. <br>To which I dedicated
                    the most time, and which undoubtedly taught me the most about soft skills, is the <a

                <p>Drawing from my experiences in various organizations, I continue to invest my free time in
                    opportunities that help me grow both personally and professionally. I'm dedicated to building my
                    soft skills and technical expertise, bridging the gap between classroom knowledge and real-world
                    experiences. It's not just about expanding my own knowledge; I'm also passionate about connecting
                    with industry professionals who generously share their insights, provide guidance, and open doors to
                    continuous learning. Their mentorship helps me learn from their successes and setbacks, and it's a
                    journey of shared experiences and common interests. Together, we're not just dreaming but turning
                    our visions into reality. One of them is <a

                <img src="images/telecom.png">
                <p>During my final year of college, I had the opportunity to undertake a mandatory internship. <br>I
                    spent
                    one month at BH Telecom in directorate Zenica, working in the <b>Department for Technical Support</b>, specifically

                        gaining various technical skills, this experience provided insights into how a <b>large corporation
                        operates</b>.
                    <br>It highlighted the significance of <b>documentation and archives</b>, which were topics we

                <p>I'm particularly thrilled about the skills I gained through various group and individual projects.
                    These experiences introduced us to agile methodologies and version control, enhancing our ability to
                    manage software development effectively. Alongside the multitude of programming languages, we
                    explored a diverse set of tools and platforms for the entire software development lifecycle. From
                    designing in Figma and 3D modeling tools to web development using Java Spring Boot, Node.js, and
                    React, we ventured into MySQL for database management, .NET MAUI for mobile app development, and
                    utilized tools like Visual Paradigm for software development and documentation. We also dabbled in
                    systems and network administration, among other subjects. Despite the extensive curriculum, it
                    provided us with a solid foundation for our future endeavors.</p>

                    web development and mobile app development, as well as agile methodologies and design. However, what intrigued
                    me the most were embedded

                <p>Specifically, my graduate thesis revolved around the concept of a smart home. Using Arduino and the
                    Blynk IoT application, I designed a prototype of a smart home with features such as mood light
                    control, heating, ventilation, plant irrigation, and an alarm system. This project allowed me to
                    apply my programming and hardware skills to create a real-life, interconnected home automation

                    hobbies. At the very least, it should help me enjoy Netflix without relying on subtitles, even if I

                    statement about sustainable fashion. It's a small step toward a more eco-friendly and stylish world,
